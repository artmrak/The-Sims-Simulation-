#**The-Sims-Simulation**
This project is a parody-simulation of such a popular game as The Sims. There are a lot of details in the code, from choosing which car to buy and which job to go to feelings of hunger, joy, satiety, fixing the car, going to the store, etc. The entire code is a year in the life of a person named Liam. This project is not as easy as it seemed to me at first glance.
